Problem statement include: • Identifying the fraudulent transactions: Develop a classification model capable of dif- ferentiating between legal and fraudulent credit card trans- actions accurately.
•	Real-time detection: Implement mechanisms to detect fraudulent activities in real-time to prevent unauthorized charges and protect customer accounts.
•	Minimizing the false positives: Strive to minimize false positives to ensure that legitimate transactions are correctly flagged as fraudulent, thereby preserving customer experi- ence and trust
The primary objective of this project is to build efficient models for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Primary objectives include:
•	Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset, identify patterns, and gain valuable insights into features for classification.
•	Pre-processing: Handle missing values, scale the dataset, and address class imbalance to prepare it for data modeling.
•	Modelling: Build and evaluate Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes models which will have an important role in classifying transactions as fraudu- lent or non-fraudulent.
